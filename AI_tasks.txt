Text as Data
1)Sequential - Text contains sentences
2)Tokenization - Each sentence has multiple words (Tokenization splitting sentences into  words)
3)Padding - Since Sentences has varying lengths, to make them equal padding is used

Similarity of sentences is measured by dot and cosine similarity and embedding

Language AI models: AI models to understand process NLP tasks
Deep Learning models that are used to train models performing language tasks are
1)Recurrent neural networks: processes data sequentially and store hidden states
2)Long Short term memory: processes data sequentially and retains context better through gates
3)transformers: processes data parallelly and understand context better by self attention


Audio and Speech as data
Sample rate : No of types in a second audio sample is take
Bit depth: No of bits in each sample

Audio and Speech AI models: Ai models to perform audio and speech related tasks
Deep learning models that are used to train models performing audio and speech related tasks are
1)recurrent neural networks
2)Long Short Term memory
3)transformers
4)variational autoencoders
5)Waveform models
6)Siamese networks


Images as Data: Consists of pixels , pixels can be grey scale or color

Vision Ai models: Ai models that are designed to understand visual info from images and audio
Deep learning models that are used to perform vision tasks are
1)Convolutional neural networks: detects patterns in the images
2)YOLO: processes images and identifies objects
3)Generative Adversarial network: generates real looking images

Other AI tasks:
1)Anamoly detection
2)Recommendation
3)Forecasting
