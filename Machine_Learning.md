# **Machine Learning :** 

Subset of Artificial Intelligence where algorithms learn from past data and make predictions, identify trends without being explicitly programmed

##### **Types of machine learning**

###### **1)Supervised machine learning:** Model that learns from data

&nbsp;Ex: House price prediction, disease detection, sentiment analysis, stock market 

&nbsp;***i)Linear regression:*** used to predict values not categories

&nbsp;  For example, house value prediction

&nbsp;	The task is to draw a best fit line that minimizes the loss function where the loss function is the square of difference bw actual 

&nbsp;  values and predicted values.

&nbsp;  The loss function is reduced by adjusting the bias and the slope of the line where adjusting bias moves the line upward and downward, and adjusting slope tilts upward and downward



&nbsp;***ii)Classification:*** type of machine learning algorithm used to predict the categories

&nbsp; -***Binary:*** If there are only two classes like 'spam' or 'not spam'

&nbsp; -***Multi class:*** If it contains multiple classes like 'positive', 'negative', or 'neutral' in sentiment analysis

&nbsp;This uses *Logistic regression*, which predicts true or false instead of continuous values.

&nbsp;Logistic regression uses a S shaped curve instead of a straight line like linear regression, so it uses a sigmoid function to take the input and predict a binary classes and brings the values b/w 0 and 1



###### **2)Unsupervised learning:** Training without any labeled data

&nbsp; Algorithms explore and learn the patterns in data without being explicitly told

&nbsp; Based on features the data is automatically grouped based on similarities which is known as Clustering

&nbsp; Outlier points are the data which doesn't fall in any of the similarities



Ex: 1)Customer Segmentation

&nbsp;   2)Outlier analysis

&nbsp;   3)Recommendation systems

&nbsp; Similarity values lie b/w 0 and 1

&nbsp; ***Workflow of unsupervised***

&nbsp;1)Prepare data

&nbsp;2)Identify similarity metrics

&nbsp;3)run clustering algorithms

&nbsp;4)Interpret results and adjust clustering



###### **3)Reinforcement learning:** Enables agent to learn from environment by receiving reward and punishment

&nbsp;Ex: teaching a dog something by giving any reward and punishment

&nbsp; 1)Autonomous vehicles

&nbsp; 2)Smart devices

&nbsp; 3)Industrial automation

&nbsp; 4)Gaming and environment



&nbsp;***Terminologies*** 

&nbsp;1)Agent: interacts with the environment and performs tasks for a specific goal

&nbsp;2)Environment: External entity that interacts with the environment

&nbsp;3)State: current situation of the environment

&nbsp;4)Action: decision taken by the agent

&nbsp;5)Policy: rules that the agent uses to decide which action to take at the particular state
