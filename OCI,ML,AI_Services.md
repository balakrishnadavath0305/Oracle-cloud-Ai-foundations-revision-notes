##### **ML Services Overview**

###### 

###### **OCI Datascience** 

*What:* Build, train and deploy ML models

*Whom:* Datascientist throught Ml cycle

*Where:* Jupyter notebook

*How:* preserve in model catalog,deploy models





**OCI Datascience features and Terminologies:**

Datascience provides projects and notebook sessions, conda environments, Accelerated Data science (ADS) SDK, Models, Model catalog, Model Deployments, and jobs



Notbook sessions provide Jupyter lab, preinstalled libraries, accelerated data, and science sdk



**What is a GPU?**

Graphic Processing unit is a piece of hardware that is incredibly good at making calculations 

Runs many processes parallelly 



**RDMA** is a three tier clo which increases the throughput and is efficient because of its features



**Responsible AI**

1)Should follow all laws

2)Must be robust

2)Human ethics



**OCI Gen AI services** is a fully managed service that provides a set of customizable LLMs available via a single API to build Gen AI applications and is available only in particular regions

i)It provides a set of models

ii)Flexible finetuning

iii)Dedicated AI clusters: GPU based inferences that hosts our fine tuning 



**Pretained foundational models**

***1)Chat models***: command r plus, command r(cohere) and llama(meta)

***2)Embedding models:*** embed English, embed multilingual(cohere)



**Finetuning**

Customizing the pretrained models and improving model efficiency for any particular tasks





**Oracle Vector AI Search**

**oracle database 23ai**

i)SQl support vector generation

ii)vector data type(tables are created)

iii)similarity search with SQL syntax and functions: *vector distance function(lesser distance=similar)*

iv)approximate search indexes



**similarity search over joins:** since industries have multiple tables to be related 



**AI vector search in Oracle Database 23ai**

Data souces->Document loaders->Document Transformation->vectors generated using embedding models->similarity search by user or RAG for LLMs







**Autonomous Database Select AI**

Simplest way to know about your database using your own language without knowing where and how data is stored



**So this process happens in this way**

1)User gives a query

2)LLM understands infers and generates the SQL query for user natural language

3)Using that SQL query the data is searched and retrieved





**AI Services**

***1)Language :*** Detects the language and identifies the sentiment, text classification, named entity recognition and key phrase extraction 

***2)Speech:*** it transcribes audio and video files without any data science expertise required

***3)Vision:*** Image classification, Object detection and Document AI(used to work with document images)



Document AI-text recognition, table extraction, key value extraction, language detection, document classification(10 types)
